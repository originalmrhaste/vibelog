## Motivation

Long lasting dream of mine is to create useful software fast. Either for joy, utility or money. I think elixir and phoenix are well strategically positioned for this task, in part because of beam and liveview. I also wanted to make a blog for a long time, but I've been paralyzed by perfectionism and unwillingness to set this up myself. Let's be honest, it's not rocket science to do this and I'm more than capable of doing so, but there was this constant exploring, not being satisfied with options, starting, stopping, abandoning.

## Enthusiasm

I saw a quote from James Clear:

> A simple rule for life that rarely fails:
> "Optimize for enthusiasm. Make as many choices as you can that leave you feeling energetic and interested. Pay attention to when you have the urge to pursue or participate in something and do more of it."

I'm really enthusiastic of being able to experiment on projects that touch on my passions, and wanted to share my journey. And I've been enthusiastic of exploring the boundaries and limitations of these new AI tools. There could be some benefit to people seeing what these boundaries are (boundaries for me at least), and decided to vibe code this blog.

The goal now will be to make small projects daily/weekly in varying levels of complexity and just exploring. If anyone anywhere ever finds something here useful, it will be worth it for me.

## AI usage transparency

My goal was to make it loud and clear I'm using ai assistance, so people who hate this new tech and think its useless, immoral, bad can easily notice and just move on, or maybe poke around and show it's actually bad. Every post that has ai code or ai writing (note: i dont count spell checks here, nor text->md conversion. This blogpost is first that has me actually writing every word, which is extremely noticeable) has a huge banner that makes it clear. My opinion is that even if llms don't improve that much, we can already benefit a lot from their current state.

For those who choose to stay, if you have ideas, suggestions, comments anything really, I welcome feedback, and am always looking to improve.

Cheers,
