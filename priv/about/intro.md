I'm **Bozidar Mitrovic**, a software engineer.

I've spent years solving problems across industries - from cybersecurity intelligence to biotech to financial services. Whether it's a startup needing to move fast or an enterprise requiring bulletproof infrastructure, I figure out what needs to be built and build it.

I'm optimistically cautious about AI-assisted development and how it's changing the way we build software. The potential is clear, but so are the complexities of making these tools work in real engineering workflows. This blog documents my experiments with various levels of "vibe coding" - exploring what works, what doesn't, and where the interesting opportunities lie.
